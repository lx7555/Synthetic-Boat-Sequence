# Synthetic-Boat-Sequence


##Abstract

Change detection is an important vision task for water-landing of unmanned aerial vehicles. Inspired by the high-density 
photoreceptors and bilateral filter mechanism, a novel biologically computational method based on the eagle-eye visual
sensitivity and lateral inhibition is proposed for change detection. This method named STabCD, which ensures spatio-temporal
distribution consistency and achieves the goal of foreground acquisition, noise-reducing, background adaptability. Therefore,
the proposed method can respond strongly to object information and suppress noise and wave texture. Then, we present a cloning
method to simulate water-scene and collect a new synthetic dataset (called “Synthetic Boat Sequence”) for the UAVs’ vision
research. Besides, we utilize synthetic dataset and corresponding real dataset to conduct experiments for change detection. The
experimental results indicate that: 1) the STabCD model achieves the best result in complex real or synthetic water-scene; 2) change
detection models of UAVs can be quantitatively analyzed and tested under synthetic scenario challenges.
